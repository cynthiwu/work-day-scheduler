## About The Project

The goal of this project was to create a simple workday scheduler. The scheduler has a row to represent each hour of the typical workday (i.e., 9AM to 5PM) where the user can enter and save tasks for that given hour. Each hour is color-coded based on whether it has passed, is current, or is in the future.

### Acceptance Criteria

The below were the acceptance criteria for this project:

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```


## Usage

This project can be used by anyone who wishes to visually keep track of their work tasks over the day. The data will persist over a browser refresh for later use.
